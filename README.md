# ImageFormMapper

ImageFormMapper is a tool for mapping and filling out scanned forms using sample data. It allows you to position all the necessary elements for mass-printing filled forms.
This has been succesfully used for 1099 MISC and NEC form filling at enterprise scale.

## How to Customize Filled Forms

To identify the elements that need to be filled in the form, use the `find_form_fields.py` script. This script will list all the field names in your form.

```bash
python find_form_fields.py
```

Simple Usage

For the primary use case, follow these steps:

1. Install conda if you donâ€™t already have it.
2. Create and activate the environment specified in environment.yml.
3. Run main.py with the path to your input CSV file as an argument.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate formfiller
python main.py input_csv
```
